What is Docker?

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package.

Advantages of Docker?

Build app only once : An application inside a container can run on any system that has docker installed.So there is no need to build and configure application 
multiple times on different platforms.
More sleep and less worry : With docker you test your application inside a container and ship it inside a container. This means the environment 
in which you test is identical to the one on which the application will run in production.
portability: Docker containers will run on any platform. It can run on any local system,Amazon EC2,Google cloud,Rackspace server,Virtual box etc 
Version control: Like GIT, Docker has inbuilt version control system. Docker containers work just like GIT repositories,allowing you to commit changes to 
your docker images and version control them.
Isolation: With docker every application works in isolation in its own container and doesnot interferes with other applications running on the same system.
so we can run multiple containers and to remove we can simply delete containers.
Productivity: Increases productivity and efficiency without worrying about platforms.

What is diff b/w docker and kubernetes?

Docker is a platform and tool for building, distributing, and running Docker containers. ... Kubernetes is a container orchestration system for Docker containers 
that is more extensive than Docker Swarm and is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner.

what is an image in Docker?

Docker images are templates used to create containers that can run on the Docker platform.Container is a running instance of image.
Images --->Binaries ,dependencies and metadata.

18. What is Hypervisor?

The hypervisor is a software which allows you to create a virtual environment in which the guest virtual machines operate. 
It controls the guest systems and checks if the resources are allocated to the guests as necessary.

---- Diff b/w Docker and virtualization?

Virtual Machine	                                                               Docker Container

Hardware-level process isolation	                                             OS level process isolation
Each VM has a separate OS	                                                     Each container can share OS
Boots in minutes	                                                             Boots in seconds
VMs are of few GBs	                                                           Containers are lightweight (KBs/MBs)
Ready-made VMs are difficult to find	                                         Pre-built docker containers are easily available
VMs can move to new host easily	                                               Containers are destroyed and re-created rather than moving
Creating VM takes a relatively longer time	                                   Containers can be created in seconds
More resource usage	                                                           Less resource usage

---- What is docker file?
Dockerfile --describes steps to create a docker image. All applications,dependencies are defined in a dockerfile to build docker image.

----What is docker demon and engine?
Docker Engine is the core product of Docker, including its daemon (dockerd) as well as its CLI (docker). Docker Daemon is simply a part of Docker Engine.

Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:

A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
A command line interface (CLI) client docker.

---What is copy and add in dockerfile?

COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes. They let you copy files from a specific location into a Docker image.

COPY takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image)
into the Docker image itself.

ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. 
Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.



CONTAINER:12

 # docker version ---->Gives the information of client,server(engine) of docker.

IMAGES:

 # docker image ls ---> gives list of existing images in our docker.
 # docker images -q --->gives only image ID
 # docker images -f "dangling=false" ---->it will filter all dangling images.(untagged)
 # docker pull nginx ---> It will download the latest image of nginx.
 # docker pull nginx:1.11 --->it will download the specific defined version of nginx. (here 1.11 is a tag).
 # docker pull nginx:1.11-alpine ---> it will download alpine supported nginx which is very small container of unix os.
 # docker history nginx:latest ---> it will give history of nginx image layers. (this command works for the images only exits in our docker)
 Note: Every layer is having its own unique SHA and the files will be stored once in images they will be accessed.
 # docker history mysql ----> Shows history of an image
 # docker history mysql:latest
 # docker image inspect nginx ---> it will gives the metadata of the nginx image.(image ID,tags,exposed ports,env variables and how the image expects to be run etc)
 
 Tags are labels point to the image ID.
 # docker image tag sourceimage(:tag) targetimage(tag) --->syntax.
 # docker image tags --help ---> it will give syntax to use tags.
 # docker image ls --->we can see tags here only
 # docker image tag nginx urmila/nginx ---->way to change the original tag and use our own.
 # docker image ls ---> now you can see the new image with our own tag but image ID is same for both.
 # docker image push urmila/docker ---> used to push our image to docker hub.
 # docker --help ---> gives options to use.
 # docker login ---> ask credentials to login to docker hub.
 # cat .docker/config.json ---> config file contains authentication token(need to be careful when using shared accouts)
 
DOCKER FILE:

Step:1 Create a file named Dockerfile. # vim Dockerfile
Step:2 Add instructions in Dockerfile
Step:3 Build Dockerfile to create image
Step:4 Run image to create container.

# getting base image docker --->comment
FROM ubuntu --->image name

RUN apt-get update ---->running ubuntu

CMD ["echo","Hello World...! from my first docker image"] ---->running cmd inside ubuntu.

  # docker run efc34aa ----> it will runs our container.

 # docker image build -t customnginx .   ----> build the docker image based on docker file steps and it will stores all info in cache and uses it when we run the
   build next time.
 # docker container run -p 80:80 --rm nginx ---> to run the container in normal way.
 # docker image build -t nginx-with-html ---->by running as a build it will be faster becoz stored in cache.
 Note: Now we can create tag to this image and push into our own docker hub.
 # docker import [URL/FILE] ---->Create an image from a tarball.
 # docker commit [CONTAINER] [NEW_IMAGE_NAME] ---->Create an image from a container.
 # docker rmi [IMAGE] ---->Remove an image.
 
 We can build our own dockerfile and run container on it.
 By modifying existing docker file we can say expose on what ever port we want, do changes as our wish and run the container, then we can tag it and push into our
 docker hub.
 # docker push [options] name[:tag] ---> syntax.
 # docker image ls ---> lists our image
 # docker image rm imagetagname ---> it will removes our image from cache need to download again if you want.
 
 Using Prune to Keep Your Docker System Clean (YouTube)
You can use "prune" commands to clean up images, volumes, build cache, and containers. Examples include:

- docker image prune --->to clean up just "dangling"(not associated with running container) images

- docker system prune ----> will clean up everything ( -f force

- The big one is usually # docker image prune -a -->which will remove all images you're not using. Use # docker system df ---> to see space usage.

Remember each one of those commands has options you can learn with --help.

Here's a YouTube video I made about it: https://youtu.be/_4QzP7uwtvI

Lastly, realize that if you're using Docker Toolbox, the Linux VM won't auto-shrink. You'll need to delete it and re-create (make sure anything in
docker containers or volumes are backed up). You can recreate the toolbox default VM with # docker-machine rm default   and then # docker-machine create

NETWORK:

# docker network ls --->lists network
# docker network rm [NETWORK] ---->Remove one or more networks
# docker network inspect [NETWORK] ---->Show information on one or more networks
# docker network connect [NETWORK] [CONTAINER] ---->Connects a container to a network
# docker network disconnect [NETWORK] [CONTAINER]. ---->Disconnect a container from a network
