What is python?
Python is a interpreted,object-oriented,high level language used in Machine learning,GUI,Software development,Web development etc that's why it is called general
purpose language.

2+3 :5
9-1 :8
2*3 :6
8/4 :2.0 --- Float value representation
5//2 :2  --- integer devision or floor devision
8+9-10 :7 --- it will work for more operations as well
8+9-  : --- invalid syntax
8+2*3 :14 --- it will follow BODMAS(brackets,orders under roots etc,Div,mul,add,sub) rule
(8+2)*3 :30 
2**3:8 --- it will act as exponent
10//3:3 --- remainder 1 is there
10%3:1 --- here % acts as modulus which will give remainder value to us
'urmila' : 'urmila' --- it will work for strings.
print('urmila') : urmila 
Note:We can use certain functions(set of tasks are defined) to do this task and here print is a prebuilt funtion, but we can also define our own functions in python.
print('urmila's notes') --- invalid syntax
print("urmila's notes") : urmila's notes --- works here
print('urmila "notes"') : urmila "notes" --- we have to use diff codes.
print('urmila's "notes"') : invalid syntax
print('urmila\'s "notes"') : urmila's "notes" --- backslash will ignore the meaning of this special character.
'python'+'python' :'pythonpython' --- string concatination
10*'python' : 'python...10 times'
print('c:\docs\navin') : 
c:\docs
avin
Note: here \n means new line
print(r'c:\docs\navin') : c:\docs\navin --- r stands for raw it will prints raw string.

Variables:

x=2 --- x is variable assigning 2 for that (its act like container)
x+3 :5
y=3
x+y :5
x=9 --- if we do like this value got changed for x.
x+y :12
x : 9 --- x enter gives 9 that value is in x
abc enter --- nameerror: name abc is not defined
x+10 :19
_+y :22 --- underscore represent previous value result and addee with y give 22
name='youtube' --- assigning strings it will work
name+' rocks' :youtube rocks --- it works
name ' rocks' --- syntax error:invalid syntax
