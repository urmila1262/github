What is the use of Adhoc commmands?

For small,easy and quick tasks we use adhoc commands instead of writing play books.Ex: to restart,to power off all servers at a time,to get uptime of all 
servers,to getting curl versions, os versions etc we can use Adhoc commands.

What is diff b/w Adhoc commands and playbooks?

To perform multiple commands at a time EX: installing http web server need to configure a package,install and start the server in this case we use play books.
But if we use adhoc commands in this case we need to run one commands for each task.

Syntax:
### command hostgroups module/arguements[options]
### ansible webserver(groupname) reboot (or) ping
### ansible all -a uptime  ---->it will give the uptime of all the hosts in the inventory file here 'a' is argument.
### ansible all -a "uname -a"  --->it will give kernal info, here we are using option in quotes rather than module.
### ansible-doc -l |more --->list of modules available in ansible
### ansible-doc -l |more |wc -l  ---->igves count of modules
### ansible-doc -l | grep -i user ---> for particular modules
### ansible-doc user --->gives detailed info of module user----it will manage user accounts and attributes {options with '=' are mandatory}
### ansible all -m ping
### ansible all -m user -a "name=ram password=redhat" ----> to create the user
### id ram --->to check the user present or not
### ansible all -a(aim) "yum -y install httpd"  ---> to install httpd
### rpm -q httpd --->to check httpd is installed or not
### ansible all -a(aim) "yum -y remove httpd" ----> remove by using the same Adhoc command
 By using modules
### ansible all -m(module) yum -a(argument)"name=httpd state=present"
### ansible-doc yum --> for help
### ansible all -m(module) yum -a(argument)"name=httpd state=absent"
