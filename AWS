What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical 
data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider 
like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Difference between AWS and Azure?
KEY DIFFERENCE
Both Azure and AWS supports hybrid cloud but Azure supports hybrid cloud better.
Azure offers express routes while AWS offers direct connection.
Azure provides security by offering permissions on the whole account whereas AWS security is provided using defined roles with permission control feature.
Azure machines are grouped into cloud service and respond to the same domain name with various ports whereas the AWS machine can be accessed separately.
Azure has a virtual network cloud whereas AWS has Virtual Private Cloud.
Azure has 140 availability zone whereas AWS has 61 availability zone.

IAAS
Networking --> storage --> servers --> Virtualization (Service provider management) O/S --> Middleware -->runtime --> data -->applications (Customer management).

PAAS
Networking --> storage --> servers --> Virtualization -->O/S --> Middleware -->runtime (Service provider management) data -->applications (Customer management).

SAAS
Networking --> storage --> servers --> Virtualization -->O/S --> Middleware -->runtime -->data -->applications. (Service provider management).

Everything will be taken care by service provider and made all this softwares available on internet for us to user for different business purposes by cloud.
ex: emailservices,online games,shoping portals,Hadoop tools etc --->SAAS

What is AWS region and availability zones?
AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. We call each group of logical data centers 
as Availability Zone. Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZ's within a geographic area.
We can select region but not AZ when creating instances.But after creation we can change default region and AZ as well.

EC2:
1.Choose AMI. ---what type  of os we want.
2.Choose instance type -- freetier and storage info.
3.Configure instance -- security ,no: of instances etc
4.Add storage -- EBS to add storage.General purpose SSD(constant) provisional IOPS SSD(dynamic)
5.Add Tags -- to give name to our instance.
6.Configure security group -- SSH remote connection, we can restrict connectivity by choosing My IP -only from my n/w,custom -commonly using n/w,anywhere-diff PCs.
Review and lunch
Lunch -- Download key pair.
connect with putty: Putty configuration --With public IP then go to connection-SSH-Auth(authentication)-keypair(.ppk)-open but putty accepts only 
putty private keys(.pem to .ppk) go to putty gen load-select .pem file-save as private key-yes-save(.ppk) with name

Login:
username RHEL : ec2-user, centos : centos, ubuntu: ec2-user, windows: administrator etc  only this default users are needed to login then we can switch to super user.

Login directly from linux VM then we can use .pem file to conncet
#ssh-i keypair(.pem) ec2-user@publicIP -- this pem file should have read only permissions to the owner(400) then only we can connect.

Actions:
Instance state -- stop, terminate, Reboot, start are there. Stop just stops the running instance but terminate removes the instance from the dashboard.
