What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical 
data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider 
like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

What is AWS region and availability zones?
AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. We call each group of logical data centers 
as Availability Zone. Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZ's within a geographic area.
