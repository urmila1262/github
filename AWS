What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical 
data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider 
like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Difference between AWS and Azure?
KEY DIFFERENCE
Both Azure and AWS supports hybrid cloud but Azure supports hybrid cloud better.
Azure offers express routes while AWS offers direct connection.
Azure provides security by offering permissions on the whole account whereas AWS security is provided using defined roles with permission control feature.
Azure machines are grouped into cloud service and respond to the same domain name with various ports whereas the AWS machine can be accessed separately.
Azure has a virtual network cloud whereas AWS has Virtual Private Cloud.
Azure has 140 availability zone whereas AWS has 61 availability zone.

IAAS
Networking --> storage --> servers --> Virtualization (Service provider management) O/S --> Middleware -->runtime --> data -->applications (Customer management).

PAAS
Networking --> storage --> servers --> Virtualization -->O/S --> Middleware -->runtime (Service provider management) data -->applications (Customer management).

SAAS
Networking --> storage --> servers --> Virtualization -->O/S --> Middleware -->runtime -->data -->applications. (Service provider management).

Everything will be taken care by service provider and made all this softwares available on internet for us to user for different business purposes by cloud.
ex: emailservices,online games,shoping portals,Hadoop tools etc --->SAAS

What is AWS region and availability zones?
AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. We call each group of logical data centers 
as Availability Zone. Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZ's within a geographic area.
We can select region but not AZ when creating instances.But after creation we can change default region and AZ as well.

EC2:
1.Choose AMI :here choose what type of os we need
2.Choose instance type: what type of instance free tier
3.Configure instance: security (N/W,vpc etc)
4.Add storage: we can add storage here for ubuntu:8GB, RHEL:10GB, windows:30GB by default for free tier.(EBS:Elastic Block Storage added storage)
   device :/dev/sda1 -- primary volume -means on which our OS is running.
   general purpose ssd -- in this IOPS is constant,provisnal IOPS(i/p and o/p per sec)--- in this IOPS can be changed as per your requirement.
5.Add Tags: give name for the instance.
6.Configure security groups: SSH protocal will go by default---custom(particular location),anywhere (login from any location),my IP(only from my network)

Review and Launch. 
choose key pair -- acknowledge -- Launch --- click instance ID go to instance details.

Login through Putty(When we are on windows to connect with remote linux server we use putty):first change .pem file to .ppk file by giving key pair
in puttygen and saving as .ppk.
Take public IP of the instance go to putty give IP there then connection-SSH-Auth-browser for key pair name(.ppk)-open
login as:ubuntu (user name)
it will authenticate key and will connect with remote server.
now we can go to super user if needed.We can install the apps we need now it will work as our physical machine.




Action:
running, stop -- will stop temporarily, terminate--- stops permanently and remove from dashboard.
when we stop instance after restarting the public IP of that instance will change, but if we want constant public IP go for elastic IP.

EC2:
1.Choose AMI. ---what type  of os we want.
2.Choose instance type -- freetier and storage info.
3.Configure instance -- security ,no: of instances etc
4.Add storage -- EBS to add storage.General purpose SSD(constant) provisional IOPS SSD(dynamic)
5.Add Tags -- to give name to our instance.
6.Configure security group -- SSH remote connection, we can restrict connectivity by choosing My IP -only from my n/w,custom -commonly using n/w,anywhere-diff PCs.
Review and lunch
Lunch -- Download key pair.
connect with putty: Putty configuration --With public IP then go to connection-SSH-Auth(authentication)-keypair(.ppk)-open but putty accepts only 
putty private keys(.pem to .ppk) go to putty gen load-select .pem file-save as private key-yes-save(.ppk) with name

Login:
username RHEL : ec2-user, centos : centos, ubuntu: ec2-user, windows: administrator etc  only this default users are needed to login then we can switch to super user.

Login directly from linux VM then we can use .pem file to conncet
#ssh-i keypair(.pem) ec2-user@publicIP -- this pem file should have read only permissions to the owner(400) then only we can connect.

Actions:
Instance state -- stop, terminate, Reboot, start are there. Stop just stops the running instance but terminate removes the instance from the dashboard.


Elastic IP address:in n/w and security select elastic ips - allocate new ip address - allocate (new IP address is created) - close
click on new ip - actions - assocate - select instance - save ---> now for that particular instance IP is associated.
Now we can check in dashboard of instances by selecting instance public ip = elastic ip even after instance is restarted.
we can also deassociate the elastic ip for that particular instance by selecting deassociate option in actions and also we can select the particuar range for 
our elastic IP. Elastic ip are chargable when they are not associated to any instance.

To connect with remote windows machine cilck on RDP - credentials (click on connect take username,for PWD click on password and choose key pair then 
select .pem file of instance and decript we will see our password and login.

Password less auth
-- ssh-keygen  ---->generate public and private keys
-- ssh-copy-id -i ---> copy the public key into the instance





so that it can be
