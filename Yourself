  My name is Urmila, I have 4 years of experience in DevOps and build release activities. Majorly I was involved in setting up CI/CD pipelines from scratch.
We were using Github enterprise as version control system. I created repositories and assigned permissions to application teams. I integreated github with Jenkins 
to fetch source code.We are using jenkins as continuous integration tool, I installed Jenkins and did master-slave configuration.Created various jenkins jobs based
on customer requirement. I have written jenkins file to create pipeline jobs. I integrated jenkins with nexus artifactory. So, whenever pipeline job run it will
push the artifact into nexus by using nexus artifact uploader plugin.

  For continuous deployment and configuration management we have Ansible. I have written various playbooks and configured them to remove manual efforts
  We have splunk for monitoring our apps and as well as infrastructure. We hosted few applications on AWS cloud where I have working experience on services like
EC2,S3,IAM,VPC,Autoscaling and ELB.
  We are using jira for project iteration and tracking purpose. We follow Agile with scrum. Usually our sprint goes for 16 days.
